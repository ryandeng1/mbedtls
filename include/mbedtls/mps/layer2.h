             * The `flush` state lives at a higher level than `clearing`:
             * If `flush` is set, Layer 2 must make sure that everything
             * that has been dispatched by the user is delivered before
             * the writing can continue. Internally, this splits into ...
             * (1) ... the data that has been dispatched by the user
             *     but which Layer 2 didn't yet dispatch to Layer 1,
             *     e.g. because Layer 2 waiting to see if it can put
             *     more data in the present record.
             * (2) ... the data that has been dispatched to Layer 1, but
             *     which Layer 1 might not yet have flushed.
             * Handling the `flush` state means dispatching the pending
             * data of type (1) first, ensuring that nothing of type (1)
             * is left, and then calling a flush on Layer 1 to handle
             * the data of type (2).
             *
             * In contrast, `clearing` solely deals with the data
             * of type (2): If it is set, the data of type (2) must
             * be flushed before any progress on writing can be made.
             *
             * Handling `flush` is done by dispatching the data of type (1)
             * to Layer 1, and then setting `clearing` to ensure the handling
             * of data of type (2) through a flush. If no progress can be
             * made on the clearing of (1) because Layer 1 is out of writing
             * space, `clearing` needs to be set in order to flush Layer 1
             * first, emptying (2), before the processing of type (1) data
             * can continue. This flow is implemented in l2_clear_pending().

             *    The relevant fields are `hdr`, `hdr_len` and `payload`
             *    and they are explained in more detail below.

             * 2) The structure `writer` representing the ongoing write from
             *    the perspective of the user, consisting of an epoch,
             *    a record content type and a writer object.
             *
             * The basic states during writing are the following:
             * 1. Initially,and whenever no outgoing record has been prepared,
             *    hdr, hdr_len and payload are unset, as is the writer.
             * 2. After preparing an outgoing record, hdr and payload are
             *    set up with buffers from Layer 1, while the writer is UNSET.
             * 3. The writer manages `payload` and is in INTERNAL state,
             *    indicating that is hasn't yet been provided to the user.
             * 4. The writer manages `payload` and is in EXTERNAL state,
             *    indicating that is has been provided to the user who then can
             *    use the writer API to provide the record contents.
             *
             * State 2 is not visible at the API boundary, but used internally
             * as an intermediate step when transitioning between the states,
             * which is done by the following functions:
             *
             * - l2_out_prepare_record transitions from state 1 to 2.
             * - l2_out_dispatch_record transitions from state 2 to 1.
             * - l2_out_track_record transitions from state 2 to 3.

 *                     mps_l2_epoch_add(), thereby transferring the
 *                     ownership to Layer 2.
 *                  4. Layer 2 maintains the transformation and destroys
 *                     and frees it once it becomes unused or the Layer 2
 *                     context is destroyed through a call to mps_l2_free().
 *                  This is analogous to passing a unique_pointer via
 *                  move-semantics in C++.
 * \param epoch     The address to which to write the identifier for
 *                  the keying material on success.
 *
 * \note            In case of TLS, this function modifies the incoming
 *                  epoch ID or the outgoing epoch ID, or both (depending
 *                  on the value of \p usage).
 *

 *                  with a to-be-registered epoch ID, and to have an
 *                  API call to Layer 2 to signal when the preparation

/**
 * \brief          Get the sequence number of last incoming record
 *                 protected with a given epoch.
 *
 * \param ctx      The address of the Layer 2 context to use.
 * \param epoch_id The ID of the epoch to use.
 * \param ctr      The address to write the sequence number of the
 *                 last incoming record of epoch \p epoch_id to.
 *
 * \note           This function constitutes an abstraction break
 *                 but is enforced by the following requirement from RFC 6347:
 *                   Upon receipt of the ServerHello, the client MUST verify
 *                   that the server version values match. In order to avoid
 *                   sequence number duplication in case of multiple
 *                   HelloVerifyRequests, the server MUST use the record
 *                   sequence number in the ClientHello as the record sequence
 *                   number in the HelloVerifyRequest.
 *
 * \return         \c 0 on success.
