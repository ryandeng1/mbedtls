/**
 * \file reader.h
 *
 * \brief This file defines reader objects, which together with their
 *        sibling writer objects form the basis for the communication
 *        between the various layers of the Mbed TLS messaging stack,
 *        as well as the communication between the messaging stack and
 *        the (D)TLS handshake protocol implementation.
 *
 * Readers provide a means of transferring incoming data from
 * a 'producer' providing it in chunks of arbitrary size, to
 * a 'consumer' which fetches and processes it in chunks of
 * again arbitrary, and potentially different, size.
 *
 * Readers can be seen as datagram-to-stream converters,
 * and they abstract away the following two tasks from the user:
 * 1. The pointer arithmetic of stepping through a producer-
 *    provided chunk in smaller chunks.
 * 2. The merging of incoming data chunks in case the
 *    consumer requests data in larger chunks than what the
 *    producer provides.
 *
 * The basic abstract flow of operation is the following:
 * - Initially, the reader is in 'producing mode'.
 * - The producer hands an incoming data buffer to the reader,
 *   moving it from 'producing' to 'consuming' mode.
 * - The consumer subsequently fetches and processes the buffer
 *   content. Once that's done -- or partially done and a consumer's
 *   requests can't be fulfilled -- the producer revokes the reader's
 *   access to the incoming data buffer, putting the reader back to
 *   producing mode.
 * - The producer subsequently gathers more incoming data and hands
 *   it to reader until the latter switches back to consuming mode
 *   if enough data is available for the last consumer request to
 *   be satisfiable.
 * - Repeat the above.
 *
 * From the perspective of the consumer, the state of the
 * reader is a potentially empty list of input buffers that
 * the reader has provided to the consumer.
 * New buffers can be requested through calls to mbedtls_reader_get(),
 * while previously obtained input buffers can be marked processed
 * through calls to mbedtls_reader_consume(), emptying the list of
 * input buffers and invalidating them from the consumer's perspective.
 * The consumer need not be aware of the distinction between consumer
 * and producer mode, because he only interfaces with the reader
 * when the latter is in consuming mode.
 *
 * From the perspective of the producer, the state of the reader
 * is one of the following:
 * - Attached: An incoming data buffer is currently
 *             being managed by the reader, and
 * - Unset: No incoming data buffer is currently
 *          managed by the reader, and all previously
 *          handed incoming data buffers have been
 *          fully processed.
 * - Accumulating: No incoming data buffer is currently
 *                 managed by the reader, but some data
 *                 from the previous incoming data buffer
 *                 hasn't been processed yet and is internally
 *                 held back.
 * The Unset and Accumulating states belong to producing mode,
 * while the Attached state belongs to consuming mode.
 *
 * Transitioning from Unset or Accumulating to Attached is
 * done via calls to mbedtls_reader_feed(), while transitioning
 * from Consuming to either Unset or Accumulating (depending
 * on what has been processed) is done via mbedtls_reader_reclaim().
 *
 * The following diagram depicts the producer-state progression:
 *
 *        +------------------+             reclaim
 *        |      Unset       +<-------------------------------------+       get

 *                 |                                                |   |      |
