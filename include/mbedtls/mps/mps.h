 *    We're waiting for the first message of the next flight from the peer.
 *    In this state, we're not yet sure whether the peer has fully received
 *    our last outgoing flight, and we retransmit the latter on timeout.

 *    the reassembly context for the next incoming flight, while during
 *    #MBEDTLS_MPS_FLIGHT_RECEIVE, the memory of the last incoming flight is
 *    erased and the reassembly context for the next incoming flight is setup.
 *  - #MBEDTLS_MPS_FLIGHT_RECEIVE
 *    We're receiving the next flight from the peer. This is different
 *    from #MBEDTLS_MPS_FLIGHT_AWAIT in that we must already have received
 *    some part of the next incoming flight, witnessing that the peer has
 *    received our last outgoing flight. In this mode, we're sending
 *    retransmission requests on a timeout, but not necessarily fully
 *    retransmit our last outgoing flight.
 *    This state is the same as #MBEDTLS_MPS_FLIGHT_AWAIT to the user.
 *  - #MBEDTLS_MPS_FLIGHT_PREPARE
 *    We're preparing out next outgoing flight. This is treated as a
 *    separate state from #MBEDTLS_MPS_FLIGHT_SEND because we can potentially
 *    temporarily free large parts of the MPS structure in that state,
 *    allowing other costly operations to have more RAM available.
 *  - #MBEDTLS_MPS_FLIGHT_SEND,
 *    We're in the process of sending our next outgoing flight.
 *  - #MBEDTLS_MPS_FLIGHT_FINALIZE
 *    The flight exchange has been completed with an outgoing flight of ours,
 *    but we're holding it back in case the peer didn't receive it.
 *    This state is the same as #MBEDTLS_MPS_FLIGHT_DONE to the user,
 *    but internally it is different because we must remember the last
 *    flight for potential retransmission.

     * Initial thoughts:
     * - For DTLS, handshake metadata isn't used after
     *   the initial call to mps_l3_write_handshake()
     *   anymore because the handshake header is written
     *   immediately. It should therefore not be stored
     *   in the Layer 3 structure in this case.
     * - For TLS, Layer 3 currently uses the stored metadata
     *   to check that the handshake message metadata doesn't
     *   change during paused-and-continued handshake writes.
     *   This is a legitimate use and makes the API harder
     *   to abuse.
     * - For DTLS, Layer 4 needs to store the handshake
     *   metadata: If a large handshake message is written
     *   by the user which fits in the writer's queue but
     *   cannot be dispatched to Layer 3 in one go, the
     *   calls to Layer 3 dispatching the remaining fragments
     *   need the metadata.
     * - Again for DTLS, Layer 4 uses the stored handshake
     *   metadata to check consistency across paused-and-continued
     *   handshake writes, making the API harder to abuse.
     *
     * It seems worth considering to remove the metadata from
     * Layer 3 and storing it solely at Layer 4.

                 *  - Active:
                 *    The next incoming handshake message is available

                 *
                 *  The interface is the following:
                 *
                 *  - Initialize
                 *    This takes the expected sequence number of the first
                 *    handshake message in the next incoming flight.
                 *
                 *  - Reset
                 *
                 *  - Feed a new handshake fragment
                 *
                 *    This is valid only in inactive state.
                 *    The reassembly submodule reacts by indicating whether the
                 *    new handshake fragment allowed to produce (parts of) the
                 *    next expected incoming handshake message to be delivered
                 *    to the user. If so, it switches to the `available` state,
                 *    and takes ownership of the handshake fragment until the
                 *    user has requested and passed back the handshake message.
                 *
                 *  - Request a new handshake message
                 *
                 *    This is valid in state `Available` only.
                 *    In this case, it provides the user with a handle to
                 *    the next incoming handshake message, and moves
                 *    to state `Active`.
                 *
                 *  - Finalize the reading of the current handshake message.
                 *
                 *    This is valid in state `Active` only and moves to
                 *    state `Inactive` or `Available`, depending on whether
                 *    the next handshake messages are already available
                 *    or not.
                 *
                 *  - Pause the reading of the current handshake message.
                 *
                 *  Internally, the complexity is in the feeding call.
                 *  When facing a new handshake message fragment, the
                 *  reassembly submodule may perform the following actions:
                 *
                 *   (1) If the fragment is an entire handshake message of
                 *       the expected epoch and sequence number, directly
                 *       pass it through to the user.
                 *   (3) If the fragment is proper and belongs to the next
                 *       incoming handshake message, extract its content
                 *       and update the reassembly process for that message.
                 *       If the fragment leads to a fully reassembled message,
                 *       or at least a sufficiently large next contiguous
                 *       chunk, it is passed to the user.
                 *   (4) If the fragment belongs to a future message and
                 *       the implementation supports buffering of future
                 *       messages, back it up.
                 *   (5) Ignore otherwise (message duplication should be
                 *       detected by the replay protection of Layer 2, but
                 *       we might receive retransmitted messages of the

         *  QUESTION:
         *  We should not always trigger retransmission when we
         *  receive a retransmitted message from an old flight:
         *  Since DTLS-1.2 does not use per-message acknowledging,
         *  flights are always retransmitted in their entirety, so if
         *  _any_ message from an old flight would trigger retransmission,
         *  we'd retransmit our last outgoing flight as many times as there
         *  are messages in the last incoming flight.
         *  The previous retransmission state machine implementation
         *  triggered retransmission only when observing the _last_ message
         *  of the previous flight. While this does prevent multiple
         *  retransmissions being triggered by a single retransmission
         *  of our peer, it may happen that the last message gets dropped
         *  and we miss a retransmission, thereby delaying the handshake.
         *
         *     Are there better solutions?
         *
         *  One approach is to have any message from the last incoming
         *  flight trigger a retransmission, but to remember that the
         *  other messages should not immediately trigger another
         *  retransmission when seen. This can be realized by maintaining
         *  two states for each message from the last incoming flight,
         *  'active' and 'on hold', with the following semantics:
         *  - If a retransmission is observed for an 'active' message,
         *    it (1) triggers retransmission of the last outgoing flight,
         *    (2) the message stays 'active', and (3) all other messages
         *    are moved to 'on hold' state.
         *  - If a retransmission is observed for an 'on hold' message,
         *    its state is changed to 'active', but no retransmission happens.
         *  This way, there will never be more than one retransmission
         *  triggered per peer-retransmitted incoming flight.

 *                 When a handshake message has been received, the user of the

 *                 using the reader returned from mbedtls_mps_read_handshake().
 *                 If the handshake message is only partially available - for
 *                 example, because it was fragments on the TLS record layer -
 *                 and the requested content goes beyond the bounds what has
 *                 already been received, this function must be called to pause
 *                 the processing of the handshake message until more data is
 *                 available. (Note: mbedtls_mps_read_consume() must only be
 *                 called if the entire handshake message has been processed,
 *                 and will fail if more data is pending, regardless of whether
 *                 that data belongs to fragments that weren't received yet).
 *
 *                 After a successful call to mbedtls_mps_read_pause(),
 *                 continuation can be attempted through subsequent calls to
 *                 mbedtls_mps_read(). If such calls indicate the availability
 *                 of a handshake message, it is guaranteed to be the
 *                 continuation of the handshake message that has been paused.
 *                 Note, however, that handshake fragments might be interleaved
 *                 with messages of other types, and hence the user must be
 *                 prepared to handle other message types, too, when attempting
 *                 to continue the reading.
 *
 *                 The recommended way to deal with initiating and continuing
 *                 the reading of a handshake message is to have a single path
 *                 calling mbedtls_mps_read() which deals with unavailability
 *                 of data as well as data of unexpected type, and to jump to
 *                 the concrete handshake message processing routine otherwise.
 *                 This routine should also maintain the state of the processing
 *                 of the handshake message, so that it would pick up the

 *                 used to fetch the message contents and returns it to the

 *                   the outgoing message to the underlying transport
 *                   immediately. In that case, we must be able to tell

 *                   (a) The call returned WANT_WRITE because there was still
 *                       data to be flushed, but the underlying transport
 *                       wasn't available.
 *                   (b) The call returned WANT_WRITE because the alert/CCS
 *                       message could be prepared but not yet delivered
 *                       to the underlying transport.
 *                   In case (a), the writing of the alert/CCS hasn't
 *                   commenced, hence we need to call this function again
 *                   for a retry. In case (b), in contrast, the record holding
 *                   the alert/CCS has been prepared and only its delivery
 *                   needs to be retried via mbedtls_mps_flush().
 *
 *                   However, the current version of MPS does never attempt
 *                   immediate delivery of messages to the underlying transport,
 *                   and hence one might omit the explicit call to
 *                   mbedtls_mps_dispatch() in this case. For now, however,

 *               identified.
 *
 * \note         The registration of the new security parameter set does
 *               not yet put it to use for reading or writing. To that end,
 *               use the functions mbedtls_mps_set_incoming_keys() and

 *                 from the heap to hold the new security parameters.
 *               - Initialize and configure the security parameters.
 *               - Register the security parameters through
 *                 a call to this function.
 *               - Enable the security parameters for reading
 *                 and/or writing via mbedtls_mps_set_incoming_kets()
 *                 or mbedtls_mps_set_outgoing_keys().
